We all
get a little

It makes us

right?

Yes it
does. I must

too.
yes.

I did

I
sincerely
apologize.

Broken.
But, hoNestly,
the mucus oozing

New York –– A review of top secret
documents suggests that water generated
through Skyquench’s much touted global
program is destined for the colonies on
Mars.
Skyquench’s CEO, Sharif Algebri, has
been in the mainstream limelight as of
late, since signing an agreement with UN
member states enabling his company to
develop a series of towers across the planet
to harvest clean water from the clouds. The
project has been applauded by economists,
arguing that not only would it afford an
abundance of clean water, but it would also
eliminate restrictions imposed on running
the Solar Grid for more than 3 hours a day.

While the Solar Grid may have helped re-
verse the effects of the Great Flood, and

spark what is dubbed as “The Solar Revo-
lution” –where industries across the globe

have had little reason to avoid a full switch
to Solar Power– there is fear that health
hazards caused by The Solar Grid are be-

Washington –– Significant groups in
both China and the United States claim
that a contest for supremacy between both

countries is leading to an unavoidable con-
flict of massive proportions. As the U.S. is

a leading member nation in the Federation
of the Global North, and China has since
been calling for a Coalition of the Global
South, a conflict ignited by either state
will surely dwarf any previous World War
known to man.
Tensions between both nations have
been increasing since a Chinese sattellite
collided with an American Mars-bound

space shuttle. All 224 passengers were ei-
ther killed upon impact, or flung out into

deep space. The Chinese government re-
leased an official apology, claiming that its

satellite moved into the shuttle’s path as a
result of an odd malfunction that could
only be the result of a spy-hack gone wrong.

The Chinese did not shy away from point-
ing fingers at Japan, which has denied all

alegations. Intel however shows that Japan
did attempt to hack into China’s defense
aparatus surrounding Miyakojima Island.
It should be noted that China only made
claim of the island a few decades following
The Great Flood, and the United Nations

has since issued multiple resolutions de-
manding the Chinese return the island to

Japan. China, however, has insisted that its
expansion towards the island is a natural
result of its population growth, and that
the population decline of Japan suggests
that the island is no longer necessary to the
Japanese people.
U.S. officials, however, claim to have
significant evidence that show that the
Japanese-Chinese dispute surrounding
Miyakojima Island has little to do with the
downing of the American space craft, and
that the Chinese government is deliberatly

Little has been known, however, of

Skyquench’s intentions to connect its wa-
ter-harvesting towers directly to space-
ports operating flights to Mars. The

Global Guardian has acquired top secret
documents from a company insider who
has chosen to remain anonymous for fear
of reprecussion. The documents reveal

detailed schematics of major pipelines con-
necting Skyquench’s towers to large-scale

spaceports with potential for water storage

capabilities. While the public has been gen-
erally positive about both The Solar Grid

and Skyquench plans, it is questionable

whether or not such sentiments will be re-
tained with knowledge of their water going

to other planets.
This information is extremely timely,

as Mars predicts a sharp increase in popu-
lation numbers over the next two months,

especially with arrangements in place for
what has been dubbed the “3rd Exodus,”
due to take place from Japan’s impressive

Space Elevator by the end of August. Stud-

BETHLEHEM HAS LEAKED SCHEMATICS FOR THE MUCH ANTICIPATED SKYQUENCH PROJECT,

“Good morning, World.
It’s an exciting day today,
especially in Hollywood.”

“The Actors with Prostate
Cancer Association, APCA,
has been campaigning to
establish a minimum quota
for films starring male
actors.”

“Gabriel Finn, also known
as the Last Man of Action, a
founding member of APCA,
is with us in the studio today
to discuss the campaign.

Also with us is award-
winning screenwriter

Aleya Akintola, best known
for penning ‘I, Infection’.
Gabriel, tell us about the
campaign.”

“Well, Jenna. This really
isn’t about having more
male-centric movies.
What its really about is
establishing a minimum
quota of films that aren’t
driven by some kind of
agenda.”

Thought we
wouldn’t
find you, huh,
BUSTER?
why didn’t
you show up
at the office
today, BUSTER?
What are
you talking
about?

I like
working at

You have
the right to
remain silent,

Shit.

What were you

why couldn’t you
just drop the cat

Verification enough for

Sure, dogs are great too.
Ah.
I like dogs.

Hey, they never have
anything to hide.

At least my dog never
walks on my shit.
You think they never have
anything to hide. They
trick you into thinking
they’re your loyal
companions.
Cats on the other hand
are honest from the get
go. They let you know
straight up that you’re a
piece of shit to them, but
they will stick with you
anyway for the food and
tummy rubs.
